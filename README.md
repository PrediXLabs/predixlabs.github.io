## Introduction

Welcome to PrediXLabs - we are glad to have you here! 

PrediXLabs is a community built with the purpose of helping you maximize potential profit in ways typically not stressed by your average ‘cook group.’ We focus on identifying items that have a very high potential to continuously, and quickly, rise in value, as well as ones currently undervalued that can turn an easy short-term profit. These ‘investment’ sneakers can often be purchased with virtually zero added effort and can generate hundreds to thousands of dollars in profit, passively, over time, if you can scale effectively as well. Finally, an important element of PrediXLabs is identifying profitable items that many resellers pass on, or do not even know exist altogether, as these lesser-known items can often generate higher and more consistent revenue with far less work. In short, PrediXLabs focuses on making your reselling experience as easy, and as profitable, as possible, using novel analytical and investment tools at your disposal. With over $2,000,000 in combined sales and years of reselling, investing, and real-world data analytics experience, we will help you to make the most of your business without spending thousands of dollars in setup costs (bots, proxies, and servers). Despite what many will tell you, it’s still very easy to make money in this industry with less time and money than your friends might be investing.

One thing that sets PrediXLabs apart from many other groups in the sneaker resale community is our emphasis on the value of data. The ability to understand and acquire valuable data, follow and discover trends, and predict the future movement of markets, we will be able to provide you with information backed up by historical and real-time proof. With our custom-built suite of tools, we will provide you with the resources to better understand investment opportunities and risks in depth.

Thank you for your support; we cannot wait to provide information and tools that create real value! If you have any questions, feel free to open a support ticket; we are always here to make your experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible!

## Live Data Feeds

First, let’s take a look into the live data section of the PrediXLabs server! The live data section is where data will be collected on sales volume and velocity during the course of a release. Our StockX Release Day feed will send a notification every 3 minutes with data on how sales volume and pricing are changing over time.

There are three possible combinations of sales volume and pricing trends that can be observed in the release day feed notifications.

(1) If sales are increasing while prices are increasing, this is a very good sign that the demand for the shoe is rising. This trend will often be observable when the release was a lot more limited than expected, and many consumers who expected to obtain a pair were left empty handed. If this trend continues over the course of a few hours during release day, this can sometimes signify a great investment opportunity! As you can see in the photo below, both the number of sales during the period, as well as the last sale price are higher than on the previous scrape.

(2) If sales are increasing while pricing is decreasing, this is typically a sign that reseller confidence is dropping in the shoe, and people are dumping. This trend often signifies that demand is lower than supply, and that people are trying to lock in profit / minimize losses while possible. If this trend continues over the course of a few hours during release day, this often signifies a poor investment opportunity. As you can see in the image below, the number of pairs being sold is increasing, however, the sale price is decreasing.

(3) If the sales volume is declining, this is almost always a very bad sign that there is little to no demand for the shoe. Since the sales volume accounts for the previous 72 hours of sales, this signifies that the volume of sales pre-release was higher than the volume of sales post-release, indicating that the shoe likely did not sell out. As you can see below, the number of pairs sold during the period decreased.

That’s all there is to interpreting the live data feed! As time passes and we log more real-time analytics from past releases, we will publish more examples here as well as regular reports on the success of our algorithms. Want a SKU to be added to the release day feed? Feel free to contact an admin / owner and we will add it! 


## Data Analytics

At PrediXLabs, we are proud to offer a suite of custom-built data analytics tools that will allow you to better understand the pricing and demand trends for any release or limited item sold in the online secondary market! These tools are available to all members in our Discord server and for sale on a subscription basis at varying tiers of availability to other groups - click here for more information if your group is interested.

### Scrapers

Our data scrapers are the backbone of our data analysis tools and cover all three of the largest U.S.-based sales platforms - StockX, Goat Group (GOAT/Alias + FlightClub/GOAT Consignment), and Stadium Goods. These tools provide relevant information including data on the number of pairs sold / available for sale, as well as the lowest list prices and highest bid prices and the respected payouts for each. This data can be incredibly useful for making on-the-fly decisions regarding whether or not to purchase an item, especially when it comes to single-pair or limited restocks. Additionally, this data can help assist in the process of determining and discovering investment opportunities in the sneaker resale market, as the single most important driver of market growth is not supply but demand. 

The following sections detail some of the differences between our three scrapers and the content you can use from them in our Discord server.

#### StockX V1

Considering StockX is the largest and most widely used sneaker resale marketplace, two tools have been developed for StockX data analysis. Combined, these tools will allow you to truly understand the supply and demand aspects for any product you desire!

StockX v1 - Our first tool, StockX V1 allows the user to understand the sales volume of any given sneaker, streetwear, or collectible product listed on StockX. This tool allows the user to see how many asks and bids exist for each variant of a product, as well as how many sales have occurred during the lifetime of the product. This information is extremely valuable, as it can give insight into how demanded a product is. A product with more asks than bids is typically less demanded than a product with more bids than asks. The best performing products are those with tons of current sales, and tons of current bids, as that indicates that there are many people who are, or were, currently in search of the product!
StockX V1 requires the following command and arguments:
?sx kw1 kw2

For example, consider the following command: `?sx yeezy mauve`. The following graph is created:

*insert relevant new sx1 graph example*

This graph indicates a strong sales history for the Yeezy 700 Mauves, with tons of volume over time. Currently, there is approximately the same amount of asks and bids for each size, indicating there is still strong demand for this product.


#### StockX V2

Our second tool, StockX V2 allows the user to understand the pricing trends for any given sneaker, streetwear, or collectible product listed on StockX. This tool allows the user to see the average sales price over time for a single, combination, or all variants of a given product(s). Unlike StockX V1, V2 allows the user to compare the average sales price for multiple different products. This can be extremely useful for determining and discovering the existence of trends and patterns.

StockX V2 requires the following command and arguments: `?sx2 kw1+kw2-size kw1+kw2-size`

For example, consider the following command: `?sx2 yeezy mauve 10.5 yeezy analog 10.5`. The following graph is created:

*insert relevant new sx2 graph example*

This graph indicates a positive pricing trend for Yeezy 700s. Both the Yeezy 700 Mauve and the Yeezy 700 Analog saw a steady rise in prices after remaining stagnant for a while. This chart indicates that Yeezy 700s have historically been a great hold!

## Investments

A key component of the PrediXLabs group offerings, and a partial component of our services offered to other groups, is our investment advice on certain newly-released items. Our posts in this category will be broken down into “Buy” notifications (related to items that are either releasing soon or items that are worth buying now) and “Sell” notifications (items that have already released and should be sold now or soon). Since offering advice on HOLDING items (in other words, an extended “buy” timeframe) will be separated into another channel. A separate channel for all types of art/collectibles advice is available as well; the main channels will focus on hyped shoes and clothing releases. 

A typical investment webhook will look something like this:

## Portfolios

As described in the previous section, being able to understand the rationale behind buying/holding or selling/passing on certain items is crucial to making the easiest money possible in the secondary market of limited items. In order to help our members understand how exactly we feel about this rationale and our predictions / outlook on items where we post investment webhooks, we have each created ‘portfolios’ of our own personal market movements related to these posts. 

Every time we make a calculated purchase or sale in line with an investment post, we will notify members with a webhook in the INVESTMENTS channel category under our respective personal channels. These webhooks will be sent in correspondence with additions to a Google Slides sheet of items and the quantities bought or sold so you can keep track of our market movements and gains/losses as time progresses. Any investment posts that manifest results in a fairly short period of time will also receive a follow-up analysis in the #wins-losses channel, where we assess the effectiveness of our initial advice and what the results may tell us about future similar posts. 

Below are example screenshots of the posts you might expect to see from this category.
